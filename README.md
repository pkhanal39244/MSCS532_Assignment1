# MSCS532_Assignment1

This Python project implements the Insertion Sort algorithm modified to arrange data in monotonically decreasing order. The program defines a function insertion_sort_descending() that sorts a list in place using comparison and element shifting logic. It demonstrates algorithmic thinking, loop control, and in-place data manipulation. The main() function provides a simple demonstration using a sample list, printing both unsorted and sorted outputs. The code includes detailed comments and adheres to best practices in readability and structure. Designed for execution in VS Code with Python 3.8+, it offers a practical introduction to algorithm implementation and program structure.
